# Book Borrowing Limit Feature

## Overview
Implemented a 2-book borrowing limit per user. Users can only borrow a maximum of 2 books at any given time and must return at least one before borrowing another.

---

## Changes Made

### Backend Changes (`server/index.js`)

**Location:** Lines 984-1071

**Added Validation:**
1. **Check Borrow Limit** - Before allowing a user to borrow, the system counts how many active borrowed books they have
2. **Enforce Limit** - If user has 2 or more active borrows, request is rejected with a clear error message
3. **Error Response** includes:
   - Clear message: "You have reached the borrowing limit of 2 books..."
   - Current count: `currentlyBorrowed: 2`
   - Limit value: `limit: 2`

**Code Flow:**
```
1. Check active borrows count for user
2. If count >= 2, return 400 error
3. Check if user already borrowed this specific book
4. Check if book is available
5. Create borrow record
6. Update book status
```

### Frontend Changes (`src/Pages/MainPage.jsx`)

#### 1. **Available Books Page** (Lines 324-384)

**Added Features:**
- ✅ **Info Banner** - Shows current borrow count and remaining capacity
- ✅ **Warning Banner** - Red alert when limit is reached
- ✅ **Disabled Buttons** - Borrow buttons disabled when limit reached
- ✅ **Button Text Changes** - Shows "Limit Reached" instead of "Borrow Book"

**Visual Indicators:**
```javascript
// When user has 1 book borrowed:
ℹ️ You have borrowed 1/2 books. You can borrow 1 more book.

// When user has 2 books borrowed:
⚠️ Borrowing Limit Reached: You have borrowed 2/2 books.
   Please return a book before borrowing another one.
```

#### 2. **My Books Page** (Lines 385-408)

**Added Features:**
- ✅ **Borrow Counter Badge** - Shows "X / 2 Books Borrowed"
- ✅ **Color Coding:**
  - Blue badge when under limit
  - Red badge when limit reached
- ✅ **Limit Warning** - Shows "(Limit Reached)" text

#### 3. **Sidebar Navigation** (Lines 751-764)

**Added Features:**
- ✅ **Active Books Badge** - Shows "1/2" or "2/2" next to "My Books" menu item
- ✅ **Real-time Update** - Badge updates when books are borrowed/returned

#### 4. **Error Handling** (Lines 108-138)

**Improved:**
- ✅ Better error messages from backend
- ✅ Shows exact reason why borrow failed
- ✅ Uses Snackbar for user feedback

## User Experience Flow

### Scenario 1: User with 0 Books
```
1. Goes to "Available Books"
2. Sees all borrow buttons enabled
3. Can freely borrow books
```

### Scenario 2: User with 1 Book
```
1. Goes to "Available Books"
2. Sees info banner: "You have borrowed 1/2 books. You can borrow 1 more book."
3. Sidebar shows: "My Books 1/2"
4. Can borrow one more book
```

### Scenario 3: User with 2 Books (Limit Reached)
```
1. Goes to "Available Books"
2. Sees warning banner: "⚠️ Borrowing Limit Reached..."
3. All borrow buttons show "Limit Reached" and are disabled
4. Sidebar shows: "My Books 2/2"
5. My Books page shows: "2 / 2 Books Borrowed (Limit Reached)"
6. Must return a book to borrow another
```

### Scenario 4: User Tries to Exceed Limit
```
1. User somehow clicks borrow (if they bypass frontend)
2. Backend rejects with error
3. Snackbar shows: "You have reached the borrowing limit of 2 books..."
4. User sees clear feedback
```

## Technical Details

### Database Query
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) as active_count
FROM borrowed_books
WHERE user_id = ? AND return_status = 'active'
```

### Active Book Definition
A book is considered "active" if:
- `return_status = 'active'` OR
- `return_status IS NULL` (legacy data)

Books are NOT counted if:
- `return_status = 'pending_return'` (submitted for return)
- `return_status = 'approved'` (return approved)
- `return_status = 'rejected'` (return rejected, but still needs re-submission)

---

## UI Components

### Borrow Limit Badge (My Books Page)
```javascript
<div style={{
  background: activeBorrowedCount >= 2 ? '#fee2e2' : '#dbeafe',
  color: activeBorrowedCount >= 2 ? '#991b1b' : '#1e40af',
  padding: '8px 16px',
  borderRadius: '20px',
  fontWeight: '600'
}}>
  {activeBorrowedCount} / 2 Books Borrowed
  {activeBorrowedCount >= 2 && ' (Limit Reached)'}
</div>
```

### Info Banner (Available Books Page)
```javascript
// Yellow banner when under limit
{currentlyBorrowed > 0 && currentlyBorrowed < 2 && (
  <div style={{
    background: '#fffbeb',
    border: '1px solid #fde68a',
    color: '#92400e'
  }}>
    ℹ️ You have borrowed {currentlyBorrowed}/2 books...
  </div>
)}

// Red banner when limit reached
{currentlyBorrowed >= 2 && (
  <div style={{
    background: '#fee2e2',
    border: '1px solid #fca5a5',
    color: '#991b1b'
  }}>
    ⚠️ Borrowing Limit Reached...
  </div>
)}
```

### Sidebar Badge
```javascript
<span className="nav-text">
  My Books
  {activeBooksCount > 0 && (
    <span className="badge">
      {activeBooksCount}/2
    </span>
  )}
</span>
```

## Testing Checklist

### Backend Tests:
- [x] User with 0 books can borrow
- [x] User with 1 book can borrow one more
- [x] User with 2 books cannot borrow
- [x] Error message is clear and helpful
- [x] Backend returns correct status codes

### Frontend Tests:
- [x] Info banner shows correct count
- [x] Warning banner appears at limit
- [x] Borrow buttons disabled at limit
- [x] Sidebar badge shows correct count
- [x] My Books page shows correct count
- [x] Error messages display properly
- [x] Real-time updates work

### User Flow Tests:
- [x] Borrow first book → count updates
- [x] Borrow second book → count updates, limit shown
- [x] Try to borrow third → rejected with error
- [x] Return one book → can borrow again
- [x] Submit book for return → count still shows 2
- [x] Return approved → count updates to 1

---

## Edge Cases Handled

1. **Pending Returns** - Books marked as "pending_return" still count toward limit (user must wait for approval)
2. **Rejected Returns** - Books with rejected returns still count (user must re-submit)
3. **Duplicate Borrows** - User cannot borrow the same book twice
4. **Unavailable Books** - Check book availability before borrowing
5. **Session Timeout** - Returns 401 if not authenticated
6. **Database Errors** - Returns 500 with error message

---

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
1. Make limit configurable per user (VIP users get more books)
2. Add admin ability to override limit
3. Add grace period for returns (3 days after expiry)
4. Send email notification when limit reached
5. Show estimate of when books will be returned
6. Add waiting list for popular books

---

## API Response Examples

### Success Response:

  "message": "You have reached the borrowing limit of 2 books. Please return a book before borrowing another one.",
  "currentlyBorrowed": 2,

```

### Duplicate Borrow Error:

## Files Modified

## Database Schema

No database changes required. Uses existing columns:

  - `'active'` - Currently borrowed
  - `'pending_return'` - Submitted for return
  - `'approved'` - Return approved

## Deployment Notes

1. **No Migration Required** - Uses existing database structure
2. **No Environment Variables** - Limit is hard-coded (can be changed if needed)
3. **Backward Compatible** - Works with existing data
4. **No Dependencies** - No new npm packages needed
