### Option 4: Deploy Keep-Alive Service on Vercel (Advanced)

If you want to run your own keep-alive service:

1. **Create a new folder**: `keep-alive-service`
2. **Create `vercel.json`**:
```json
{
  "crons": [{
    "path": "/api/ping",
    "schedule": "*/10 * * * *"
  }]
}
```

3. **Create `api/ping.js`**:
```javascript
export default async function handler(req, res) {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('https://library-backend-2-uvqp.onrender.com/health');
    const data = await response.json();

    console.log('Server pinged successfully:', data);
    res.status(200).json({ message: 'Server pinged', data });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error pinging server:', error);
    res.status(500).json({ error: 'Failed to ping server' });
  }
}
```

4. **Deploy to Vercel**:
```bash
cd keep-alive-service
vercel deploy --prod
```

## ⚡ Optimize Performance (Fix Slow Login)

Even with keep-alive, you can improve speed:

### 1. Add Connection Pooling

Edit `server/db.js`:

```javascript
const mysql = require('mysql2');

const pool = mysql.createPool({
  host: process.env.DB_HOST,
  user: process.env.DB_USER,
  password: process.env.DB_PASSWORD,
  database: process.env.DB_NAME,
  waitForConnections: true,
  connectionLimit: 10,        // Max connections
  queueLimit: 0,
  enableKeepAlive: true,      // Keep connections alive
  keepAliveInitialDelay: 0
});

module.exports = pool.promise();
```

### 2. Add Response Compression

In `server/index.js`:

```javascript
const compression = require('compression');
app.use(compression());
```

Install:
```bash
npm install compression
```

### 3. Add Request Timeout

```javascript
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  req.setTimeout(30000); // 30 seconds
  next();
});
```

## 📊 Monitor Your Server

After setting up keep-alive, monitor your server:

### Check Server Status:
```bash
# Test health endpoint
curl https://library-backend-2-uvqp.onrender.com/health
```

### Expected Response:
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-23T12:00:00.000Z",
  "environment": "production"
}
```

## ❓ FAQ

### Q: Why does my server still shut down with UptimeRobot?
**A**: Make sure the monitoring interval is 5-10 minutes (not longer). Render sleeps after 15 minutes of inactivity.

### Q: Can I run keep-alive from my laptop?
**A**: No! Your laptop needs to be on 24/7. Use a cloud service like UptimeRobot instead.

### Q: Is this allowed by Render?
**A**: Yes! Using monitoring services is allowed and common practice.

### Q: My server is still slow. Why?
**A**:
- Cold starts take 30-60 seconds (first request after sleep)
- Check database connection (Clever Cloud)
- Optimize database queries
- Add connection pooling
- Consider upgrading to paid plan

## 🎯 Recommended Solution

**For your use case, I recommend**:

1. ✅ **Use UptimeRobot** (free, reliable, no coding)
2. ✅ **Add compression** to backend (faster responses)
3. ✅ **Optimize database connection pooling**
4. 💰 **Consider Render Starter plan** ($7/month) for production

This will keep your server alive 24/7 and improve performance!
