## Support

### Common Questions

**Q: Do search results persist when I change tabs?**
A: No, search is reset when you change tabs. This is intentional for a clean UX.

**Q: Can I search for partial words?**
A: Yes! The search uses `.includes()` which matches partial strings.

**Q: Why do emails sometimes go to spam?**
A: Gmail may flag automated emails. Users should check spam folder and mark as "Not Spam".

**Q: What if email sending fails?**
A: User approval still succeeds. Email failure is logged but doesn't block the process.

**Q: Can I use a different email provider?**
A: Yes! See `EMAIL_NOTIFICATION_SETUP.md` for custom SMTP configuration.
