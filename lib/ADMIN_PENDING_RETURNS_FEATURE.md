# Admin Pending Returns Feature - Implementation Summary

## Date: 2025-10-18

## ✅ What Was Added

I've successfully added the **Pending Returns** feature to the Admin Dashboard so admins can approve or reject book returns.

### Changes Made to `AdminDashboard.jsx`

#### 1. Added State Management
```javascript
const [pendingReturns, setPendingReturns] = useState([]);
```

#### 2. Added Data Fetching
Updated the `useEffect` to fetch pending returns when the `pending-returns` tab is active:
```javascript
else if (activeTab === 'pending-returns') {
  res = await axios.get('http://localhost:5000/api/admin/pending-returns', { withCredentials: true });
  if (res) setPendingReturns(res.data);
}
```

#### 3. Added Handler Functions

**Approve Return Handler:**
```javascript
const handleApproveReturn = async (borrowId) => {
  // Confirms with admin
  // Calls /api/admin/approve-return endpoint
  // Refreshes the pending returns list
  // Shows success/error message
}
```

**Reject Return Handler:**
```javascript
const handleRejectReturn = async (borrowId) => {
  // Prompts admin for rejection reason
  // Calls /api/admin/reject-return endpoint
  // Refreshes the pending returns list
  // Shows success/error message
}
```

#### 4. Added Navigation Tab
New sidebar button:
```javascript
<button className={`nav-item${activeTab === 'pending-returns' ? ' active' : ''}`}
        onClick={() => setActiveTab('pending-returns')}>
  <span className="nav-icon">⏳</span>
  <span className="nav-text">Pending Returns</span>
</button>
```

#### 5. Added UI Section
Complete table view showing:
- Book Title
- Author
- Accession Number
- Borrower Name
- Username
- Borrowed Date
- Submitted Date
- Action buttons (Approve/Reject)

## 🎯 How It Works

### User Flow

1. **User submits book return:**
   - User goes to "My Books"
   - Clicks "Submit Book"
   - Book status changes to "Pending Return"

2. **Admin reviews the request:**
   - Admin logs in at `/admin-login`
   - Navigates to admin dashboard
   - Clicks "Pending Returns" tab (⏳ icon)
   - Sees list of all pending return requests

3. **Admin approves the return:**
   - Clicks "✅ Approve" button
   - Confirms the action
   - Book becomes available again
   - User's book moves to history
   - Pending request disappears from list

4. **Admin rejects the return (alternative):**
   - Clicks "❌ Reject" button
   - Enters rejection reason
   - Book stays borrowed
   - User sees rejection reason
   - User can re-submit

## 🔧 Database Changes During Actions

### When Admin Approves:
```sql
-- borrowed_books table
UPDATE borrowed_books SET
  return_status = 'approved',
  approved_by = 1,  -- admin id
  approved_at = NOW()
WHERE id = 1;

-- books table
UPDATE books SET
  status = 'available'
WHERE id = 5;
```

### When Admin Rejects:
```sql
-- borrowed_books table
UPDATE borrowed_books SET
  return_status = 'rejected',
  approved_by = 1,  -- admin id
  approved_at = NOW(),
  rejection_reason = 'Book not received',
  returned_at = NULL  -- reset submission
WHERE id = 1;

-- books table
UPDATE books SET
  status = 'borrowed'  -- stays borrowed
WHERE id = 5;
```
